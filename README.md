> Luft, the Swedish (and German, Danish and Norwegian) word for air.

Luft aims to help you write shorter, lighter and more readable view controllers. Luft colors your Xcode gutter in a nice green when your view controller is light. When it starts to get a bit heavier, the gutter turns yellow to warn you that it's time to start moving code to other places. If you ignore the warning the gutter eventually turns red as you add more code.

## Installation
